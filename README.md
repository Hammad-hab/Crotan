# Croton, a language that gives you all the control

Welcome to croton, a language that features a new and furturistic syntax that rejects the concepts and values of traditional C.

## About Croton

Croton is a dynamically typed, interpreted hybrid programming language that combines the elite concepts of Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming. Objects, instead of being mutable entites are immutable constant datatypes that are interacted with using functions. Croton is written in JavaScript which allows it to directly interact with JS code and the browser by the means of extentions made using JS. The point of Croton is to allow developers to have more control over this code.

## Features of Croton

#### Unique Syntax

While it is true that croton is a curly-bracket language like C, croton tends to recreate various syntactic things that C didn't have.

## Example Programs

##### Hello world example:

```rust
[parserlog Hello-World]
```

OR

```js
dftba("Hello World")
```
